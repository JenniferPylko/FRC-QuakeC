Please Open Issues
==================

Any issues regarding unimplemented classes from WPILib I am aware of and working on, please don't submit issues for those. However, if there are any builtin functions that need to be implemented that are not directly related to a WPILib class, submit an issue for that. If there are features in the VM or QuakeC code that you want implemented and would not be as a result of implementing WPILib classes, submit an issue. If there are any bugs you encounter with the VM or the QuakeC that are not a result of a great big `//UNIMPLEMENTED` next to the function in builtins.qh, submit an issue. If you have questions about how the code works, open an issue. I'll answer and also add documentation.
